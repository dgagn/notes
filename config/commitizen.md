## Commitizen

Commitizen is very important to keep your
commit consistent with the [Conventional Commit Guideline](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). It adds a command to the terminal.
```console
cz
```
That command brings a menu to help the user commit with the [angular]() convention.

To install the `cz` command in a project, simply run the command -
```console
commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --yarn --dev --exact

```
